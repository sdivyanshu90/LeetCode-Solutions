# Reaching Points

## Problem Summary

Given four integers `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty`, return `true` if it is possible to convert the point `(sx, sy)` to the point `(tx, ty)` through some operations, or false otherwise.

The allowed operation on some point `(x, y)` is to convert it to either `(x, x + y)` or `(x + y, y)`.

                    tx %= ty
                else:
                    return (tx - sx) % ty == 0
            else:
                if tx > sx:
                    ty %= tx
                else:
                    return (ty - sy) % tx == 0
        return tx == sx and ty == sy
def test_reaching_points():
    solution = Solution()
    sx, sy, tx, ty = 1, 1, 3, 5
    print(solution.reachingPoints(sx, sy, tx, ty)) # Expected: True
    sx, sy, tx, ty = 1, 1, 2, 2
    print(solution.reachingPoints(sx, sy, tx, ty)) # Expected: False
    sx, sy, tx, ty = 1, 2, 5, 7
    print(solution.reachingPoints(sx, sy, tx, ty)) # Expected: True
    sx, sy, tx, ty = 2, 2, 12, 8
    print(solution.reachingPoints(sx, sy, tx, ty)) # Expected: False
    sx, sy, tx, ty = 3, 3, 12, 9
    print(solution.reachingPoints(sx, sy, tx, ty)) # Expected: True
    sx, sy, tx, ty = 1, 4, 5, 9

### How It Works

The algorithm executes in the following steps:

1. **Parse and Initialize**: Set up necessary data structures
2. **Main Algorithm**: Execute the core algorithm logic
3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Manage boundary and special conditions
4. **Return Result**: Compute and return final answer

**Example Walkthrough**:

Let's trace through the algorithm with concrete examples:

### Why Algorithm Works

This approach is optimal because:

1. Solves the problem correctly
2. Follows algorithm best practices

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: Varies based on algorithm
  - Each operation is performed efficiently
  - Avoids redundant computation
  - Optimal for problem constraints

- **Space Complexity**: Varies based on algorithm
  - Uses necessary auxiliary data structures
  - Memory-efficient implementation
  - Optimizes storage requirements

### Advantages

- Solves the problem correctly
- Follows algorithm best practices

### Disadvantages

- May have optimization opportunities

## Alternative Approaches

### Brute Force Approach

- Check all possibilities exhaustively
- Time: O(n²) or worse
- Space: O(1) minimal extra space
- Pros: Simple logic
- Cons: Too slow for constraints

### Different Data Structure

- Use alternative data structures
- May have different complexity trade-offs
- Could simplify or complicate logic
- Worth considering but likely slower

## Edge Cases

Important edge cases to test:

1. **Empty Input**: Empty array, string, or null input
2. **Single Element**: Only one element in input
3. **Minimum Size**: Smallest valid input
4. **Maximum Size**: Largest possible input
5. **All Same Values**: All identical elements
6. **Duplicates**: Repeated values
7. **Negative Numbers**: Negative integer handling
8. **Zero Values**: Zero in input
9. **Boundary Values**: Minimum/maximum possible values
10. **Special Patterns**: Sorted, reverse sorted, etc.

## Test Cases

```python
# Basic cases
solution.solve(typical_input)  # Standard test

# Edge cases
solution.solve([])             # Empty
solution.solve([1])            # Single element
solution.solve([1, 1])         # Duplicates

# Large inputs
solution.solve(large_array)    # Performance test

# Special patterns
solution.solve(sorted_array)   # Already sorted
solution.solve(reverse_array)  # Reverse order
```
