# Full Justify

## Problem Summary

Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

<b>Note:</b>

- A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
- Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
- The input array `words` contains at least one word.

## Approach: Algorithm (Implemented)

### Strategy

Implement the algorithm as shown in the solution class.

**Code Snippet**:

```python
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def fullJustify(self, words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        line = []
        line_length = 0
        for word in words:
            if line_length + len(line) + len(word) <= maxWidth:
                line.append(word)
                line_length += len(word)
            else:
                result.append(self.format_line(line, maxWidth))
                line = [word]
                line_length = len(word)
        result.append(' '.join(line).ljust(maxWidth))
        return result
    def format_line(self, line, maxWidth):
        if len(line) == 1:
            return line[0].ljust(maxWidth)
        total_spaces = maxWidth - sum(len(word) for word in line)
        space_gaps = len(line) - 1
        spaces_per_gap = total_spaces // space_gaps
        extra_spaces = total_spaces % space_gaps
        formatted_line = line[0]
        for i in range(1, len(line)):
            if extra_spaces > 0:
                spaces = spaces_per_gap + 1
                extra_spaces -= 1
            else:
                spaces = spaces_per_gap
            formatted_line += ' ' * spaces + line[i]
        return formatted_line
def test_full_justify():
    solution = Solution()
    print(solution.fullJustify(["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], 16))
    print(solution.fullJustify(["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], 16))
    print(solution.fullJustify(["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
                                "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], 20))
    print(solution.fullJustify(["Hello"], 10))
    print(solution.fullJustify(["A", "quick", "brown", "fox"], 15))
    print(solution.fullJustify(["The", "sky", "is", "blue"], 10))
    print(solution.fullJustify(["Longword"], 8))
    print(solution.fullJustify(["Fit"], 3))
    print(solution.fullJustify(["Two", "words"], 10))
    print(solution.fullJustify(["One", "more", "test", "case"], 12))

The algorithm executes in the following steps:

1. **Parse and Initialize**: Set up necessary data structures
2. **Main Algorithm**: Execute the core algorithm logic
3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Manage boundary and special conditions
4. **Return Result**: Compute and return final answer

**Example Walkthrough**:

Let's trace through the algorithm with concrete examples:

### Why Algorithm Works

This approach is optimal because:

1. Solves the problem correctly
2. Follows algorithm best practices

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: Varies based on algorithm
  - Each operation is performed efficiently
  - Avoids redundant computation
  - Optimal for problem constraints

- **Space Complexity**: Varies based on algorithm
  - Uses necessary auxiliary data structures
  - Memory-efficient implementation
  - Optimizes storage requirements

### Advantages

## Alternative Approaches

### Brute Force Approach

### Different Data Structure

- Use alternative data structures
- May have different complexity trade-offs
- Could simplify or complicate logic
- Worth considering but likely slower

## Edge Cases

Important edge cases to test:

1. **Empty Input**: Empty array, string, or null input
2. **Single Element**: Only one element in input
3. **Minimum Size**: Smallest valid input
4. **Maximum Size**: Largest possible input
5. **All Same Values**: All identical elements
6. **Duplicates**: Repeated values
7. **Negative Numbers**: Negative integer handling
8. **Zero Values**: Zero in input
9. **Boundary Values**: Minimum/maximum possible values
10. **Special Patterns**: Sorted, reverse sorted, etc.

## Test Cases

```python
# Basic cases
solution.solve(typical_input)  # Standard test

# Edge cases
solution.solve([])             # Empty
solution.solve([1])            # Single element
solution.solve([1, 1])         # Duplicates

# Large inputs
solution.solve(large_array)    # Performance test

# Special patterns
solution.solve(sorted_array)   # Already sorted
solution.solve(reverse_array)  # Reverse order
```
