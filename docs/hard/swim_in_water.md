# Swim in Rising Water

## Problem Summary

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

It starts raining, and water gradually rises over time. At time `t`, the water level is `t`, meaning <b>any</b> cell with elevation less than equal to `t` is submerged or reachable.

You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return the minimum time until you can reach the bottom right square `(n - 1, n - 1)` if you start at the top left square `(0, 0)`.

**Code Snippet**:

```python
import heapq
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        visited = set()
        heap = [(grid[0][0], 0, 0)]
        directions = [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]
        res = 0
        while heap:
            t, r, c = heapq.heappop(heap)
            res = max(res, t)
            if (r, c) == (n-1, n-1):
                return res
            if (r, c) in visited:
                continue
            visited.add((r, c))
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (grid[nr][nc], nr, nc))
        return res
def test_swim_in_water():
    solution = Solution()
    grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
    print(solution.swimInWater(grid)) # Expected: 3
    grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],
            [24,23,22,21,5],
            [12,13,14,15,16],
            [11,17,18,19,20],
            [10,9,8,7,6]]
    print(solution.swimInWater(grid)) # Expected: 16
    grid = [[7,34,6,1,9,4],
            [14,2,8,15,10,3],
            [23,20,5,19,12,11],
            [16,28,25,24,27,13],
            [29,17,30,21,22,18],
            [35,32,31,33,0,26]]
    print(solution.swimInWater(grid)) # Expected: 26
    grid = [[0]]
    print(solution.swimInWater(grid)) # Expected: 0
    grid = [[10,12,15],
            [9,11,13],
            [8,7,6]]
    print(solution.swimInWater(grid)) # Expected: 10
test_swim_in_water()

### How It Works

The algorithm executes in the following steps:

1. **Parse and Initialize**: Set up necessary data structures
2. **Main Algorithm**: Execute the core algorithm logic
3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Manage boundary and special conditions
4. **Return Result**: Compute and return final answer

**Example Walkthrough**:

Let's trace through the algorithm with concrete examples:

### Why Algorithm Works

This approach is optimal because:

1. Solves the problem correctly
2. Follows algorithm best practices

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: Varies based on algorithm
  - Each operation is performed efficiently
  - Avoids redundant computation
  - Optimal for problem constraints

- **Space Complexity**: Varies based on algorithm
  - Uses necessary auxiliary data structures
  - Memory-efficient implementation
  - Optimizes storage requirements

### Advantages

- Solves the problem correctly

### Disadvantages

- May have optimization opportunities

## Alternative Approaches

### Brute Force Approach

- Check all possibilities exhaustively
- Time: O(n²) or worse
- Space: O(1) minimal extra space
- Pros: Simple logic
- Cons: Too slow for constraints

### Different Data Structure

- Use alternative data structures
- May have different complexity trade-offs
- Could simplify or complicate logic
- Worth considering but likely slower

## Edge Cases

Important edge cases to test:

1. **Empty Input**: Empty array, string, or null input
2. **Single Element**: Only one element in input
3. **Minimum Size**: Smallest valid input
4. **Maximum Size**: Largest possible input
5. **All Same Values**: All identical elements
6. **Duplicates**: Repeated values
7. **Negative Numbers**: Negative integer handling
8. **Zero Values**: Zero in input
9. **Boundary Values**: Minimum/maximum possible values
10. **Special Patterns**: Sorted, reverse sorted, etc.

## Test Cases

```python
# Basic cases
solution.solve(typical_input)  # Standard test

# Edge cases
solution.solve([])             # Empty
solution.solve([1])            # Single element
solution.solve([1, 1])         # Duplicates

# Large inputs
solution.solve(large_array)    # Performance test

# Special patterns
solution.solve(sorted_array)   # Already sorted
solution.solve(reverse_array)  # Reverse order
```
